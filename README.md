# MyFirstApp
This is my first mobile application. It is very minimalistic and simple to use. I developed it using ionic 3.
# How to use the App
The application is using LocalStorage or LocalForage as its storage. Use 'ionic serve' to launch the application in the web browser. The root page is the login page and since you have no account yet, you will be required to sign up for an account.
Once you have signed up, an account will be created for you and the app will navigate to the home page. Here you will be required to add new activities to the page.
